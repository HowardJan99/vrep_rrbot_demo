#### Vrep Demo

1. [rrbot_sim_w_angles](./rrbot_sim_w_angles) is a simple rrbot simulation driven by angles calculated by using forward dynamics method. In this simulation all the dynamics property of the robot are disabled, and the joint mode for all the joints is set to passive. All angles were calculated using 100ms time step in forward dynamics.
